# Projected DMET

This set of code provides routine to perform ground-state and real-time projected DMET calculations

Dependencies:

- pyscf (https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf)

Notation:

- 2e- integrals uses chemist notation
- the 1RDM is given as rho_pq = < c_q^dag c_p >
- the 2RDM is given as gamma_prqs = < c_p^dag c_q^dag c_s c_r >
